I built this demo with our partner - GumpCome, this demo shows how we can use bot + LUIS in a real project. In bot, when handling intent, I just reused existing cloud API to get vending machine information. Please refer to this project to build your own bot with your APIs. 

## 3. [VendingMachineWetChatBotWebSite](https://github.com/leonlj/BotDemo/tree/master/VendingMachineWetChatBotWebSite)

## 5. Connect bot with WeChat offical account app via Direct Line V1.1 [WeChatWithBot_DL1.1](https://github.com/leonlj/BotDemo/tree/master/WeChatWithBot_DL1.1)
In this example, it used bot FW direct line v1.1 rest API to connect WeChat offical account with bot. The code is based on C#. Please refer to this example, and conenct your bot with your WeChat app/offical account

## 6. bot direct line V3.0 C# SDK based on Rest API [BotDirectLineV3RestfulAPI_C#_SDK_withDemo](https://github.com/leonlj/BotDemo/tree/master/BotDirectLineV3RestfulAPI_C%23_SDK_withDemo/BotDemo2)
Now, bot DL V3.0 has been released with performance improvment. But there are some changes in rest API comparing with V1.1 DL. To easily use bot DL V3 to connect WeChat, native app, there is C# SDK that encapsulates raw rest api with class. You can use the SDK in your app to connect with your bot in DL V3 

## 7. Connect bot with powerbi and use card mode to show different form and information [BotAppWithPowerBi_CardMode](https://github.com/leonlj/BotDemo/tree/master/BotAppWithPowerBi_CardMode)
In powerbi+bot hackfest, the partners use bot to connect with PowerBi embedded link. The user can talk to bot to get Bi forms, in additon, in bot it also use card mode to interact with user. Good example for card mode and connect power bi.
